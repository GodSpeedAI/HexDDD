### Root Cause Analysis

The CI failures were caused by a **multi-layered issue**:

#### Primary Cause: NODE_ENV=production

- The smoke.yml workflow set `NODE_ENV=production`
- This caused `npm ci` to skip devDependencies
- nx and all @nx/* packages are in devDependencies
- Result: Only 956/3179 packages installed (22 deps vs 64 devDeps)
- Smoke tests failed with "Could not find Nx modules"

#### Secondary Issues

- GitHub Actions npm cache corruption (partially causing the issue)
- Outdated package-lock.json structure

### The Fix

**Step 1**: Disabled npm caching in all workflows

```yaml
# Commented out to force fresh installs
# cache: 'npm'
```

**Step 2**: Regenerated package-lock.json

```bash
rm package-lock.json
npm install --package-lock-only --legacy-peer-deps
```

- Cleaned up from 3438 to 3179 packages
- Verified nx@21.5.2 present

**Step 3**: Removed NODE_ENV=production ⭐ (Critical)

```yaml
# Before:
jobs:
  smoke:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      NODE_ENV: production

# After:
jobs:
  smoke:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Removed NODE_ENV to allow devDeps installation
```

## Timeline

### Investigation Phase (2 hours)

1. Discovered all PRs failing with "Could not find Nx modules" error
2. Investigated nx command invocation patterns (nx vs npx nx vs npm exec nx)
3. Discovered npm ci installing only 956 packages vs expected 3180+
4. Initially suspected cache corruption and package-lock issues
5. Regenerated package-lock.json and disabled caching
6. **Breakthrough**: Realized NODE_ENV=production was the root cause

### Resolution Phase (30 minutes)

1. Removed NODE_ENV=production from smoke workflow
2. Pushed fix to main
3. Merged fixes into all PR branches
4. Verified all CI workflows pass
5. Merged all 3 PRs successfully
6. Cleaned up branches

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Insights

1. ✅ **Never set NODE_ENV=production in CI if devDependencies are needed for builds**
   - Build tools (nx, webpack, vite, etc.) are typically devDependencies
   - npm ci respects NODE_ENV and skips devDeps in production mode

2. ✅ **Verify actual package counts in CI logs**
   - Always check "added X packages" matches expectations
   - Discrepancies indicate environmental issues

3. ✅ **Disable caching when troubleshooting package issues**
   - GitHub Actions npm cache can become corrupted
   - Fresh installs are essential for debugging

4. ✅ **Use proper flags for peer dependency conflicts**
   - `--legacy-peer-deps` resolves version conflicts
   - Better than `--force` for most cases

### Debugging Methodology

1. Read actual CI logs, not just summaries
2. Compare local vs CI package installation counts
3. Understand how environment variables affect package managers
4. Rule out issues systematically (apps, lock files, cache, environment)

## Current State

### Repository Status

- ✅ Main branch: all CI workflows passing
  - Example Apps Smoke: ✅
  - Python Tests: ✅
  - CodeQL: ✅
  - Type Sync: ✅

### Branches

- ✅ All PR branches deleted (local and remote)
- ✅ No open pull requests
- ✅ No stale branches

### Documentation

- ✅ Comprehensive troubleshooting guide created
- ✅ Root cause analysis documented
- ✅ Lessons learned captured
- ✅ Executive summary completed

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

### Consider Re-enabling npm Cache

Once confident in stability:

```yaml
- name: Setup Node
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    cache: 'npm'
    cache-dependency-path: '**/package-lock.json'
```

### Consider Moving Build Tools to Dependencies

If smoke tests represent production builds:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "nx": "^21.5.2",
    "@nx/next": "21.4.1",
    // other build tools needed for production builds
  }
}
```

### Monitor for Dependabot Alerts

- 2 moderate vulnerabilities currently flagged
- Address in future PRs as needed

## Conclusion

**Mission Complete**: All pull requests successfully resolved, merged, and branches cleaned up. The root cause (NODE_ENV=production skipping devDependencies) has been identified and fixed. Main branch CI is green. Repository is healthy and ready for continued development.

**Key Takeaway**: Environment variables like NODE_ENV have significant impact on package manager behavior. Always consider the full CI environment context when debugging installation issues.
