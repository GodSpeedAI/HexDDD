# HexDDD Commercial License Agreement

**Version 1.0 — October 2025**

This Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is between **GodSpeed AI** ("Licensor") and the customer ("Licensee") for the **HexDDD** software system.

---

## 1. DEFINITIONS

* **"Software" or "HexDDD"** means the HexDDD software system, including all associated documentation, APIs, components, modules, and updates.

* **"Internal Use"** means use of HexDDD within an organization solely for that organization’s own operations, without making HexDDD’s functionality available to third parties.

* **"Output"** means any software, applications, or systems generated *by* HexDDD that operate independently of HexDDD (similar to artwork created in Photoshop).

* **"Redistribution"** means providing HexDDD itself (in whole or in part) to third parties, whether for free or for payment.

---

## 2. WHAT’S ALLOWED WITHOUT THIS LICENSE

Under the **MPL-2.0 open source license**, you may:

* **Internal Use:** Run and use HexDDD within your own organization for any purpose that does not involve providing HexDDD’s functionality to third parties.
* **Personal Use:** Run HexDDD for personal, educational, or reHexDDDrch purposes.
* **Output Ownership:** All software, applications, or systems generated *by* HexDDD are your property. You may use, license, or sell such Output without limitation, provided the Output does not include HexDDD itself.

---

## 3. WHAT REQUIRES THIS COMMERCIAL LICENSE

You must obtain a commercial license if you:

1. **Redistribute HexDDD**

   * Provide HexDDD itself (in whole or in part) to third parties.
   * Include HexDDD in a distributed product, software bundle, or appliance.

2. **Offer HexDDD as a Service**

   * Host HexDDD (or a derivative) for third parties via SaaS, cloud APIs, managed services, or similar.
   * Permit external users to directly or indirectly access HexDDD’s functionality.

3. **Rebrand or White-Label**

   * Market HexDDD or HexDDD-derived functionality as your own proprietary product or technology.

**Boundary Rule:** If third parties are interacting with HexDDD itself, you need a commercial license. If third parties are only using your Output (which operates independently of HexDDD), no commercial license is required.

---

## 4. THE PHOTOSHOP PRINCIPLE

Just as Adobe Photoshop users:

* Can use Photoshop internally without restriction
* Own their created artwork completely
* Cannot resell Photoshop itself
* Cannot offer "Photoshop-as-a-Service"

HexDDD users:

* Can use HexDDD internally without restriction
* Own their generated software completely
* Cannot resell HexDDD itself
* Cannot offer "HexDDD-as-a-Service"

---

## 5. OUTPUT OWNERSHIP CLARIFICATION

* **Licensee’s Exclusive Rights:** All Output generated by Licensee using HexDDD is solely Licensee’s property.
* **Independence:** Output does not inherit any license obligations from HexDDD.
* **No HexDDD in Output:** This ownership only applies where Output does not include HexDDD code or components. If Output incorporates HexDDD itself, that portion remains subject to HexDDD’s license terms.

---

## 6. GRANT OF LICENSE (When Required)

For activities requiring a commercial license (per Section 3), Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to redistribute HexDDD or offer HexDDD’s functionality as a service, subject to:

* Payment of applicable license fees
* Compliance with this Agreement
* Restrictions on sublicensing, reverse engineering, or removal of notices

---

## 7. FEES

* Annual fees are based on redistribution or service tier.
* Fees are due in advance and are non-refundable.
* Non-payment for 30 days may result in suspension.
* Non-payment for 60 days may result in termination.

---

## 8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

* HexDDD remains the sole property of Licensor.
* Output created with HexDDD is the sole property of Licensee.
* Feedback about HexDDD becomes Licensor’s property.
* No reverse engineering of HexDDD is permitted.

---

## 9. AUDIT RIGHTS

* Licensor may conduct one compliance audit per year with at least 30 days’ notice.
* Audit scope is limited to verifying compliance with redistribution/service limits.
* Audits must be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner minimizing disruption.
* If non-compliance is found, Licensee must pay any fee shortfall plus reasonable audit costs.

---

## 10. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

HexDDD IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES. LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

---

## 11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

LICENSOR’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO FEES PAID BY LICENSEE IN THE PRECEDING 12 MONTHS. LICENSOR IS NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

---

## 12. TERMINATION

* For paid licenses: breach allows a 30-day cure period.
* Immediate termination for unauthorized redistribution or service offering.
* MPL-2.0 open source rights remain unaffected.

---

## 13. GOVERNING LAW
