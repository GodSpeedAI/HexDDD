# DDD/Hex Architecture Plugin for Nx Monorepos

This repository provides a plugin for Nx monorepos that facilitates the implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture principles. It includes tools for type generation, dependency management, and project structuring to help developers build scalable and maintainable applications.

## Nx Project Graph (Offline)

- An offline Nx project graph is checked into the repo for convenience: `nx-graph.html` at the workspace root.
- Open `nx-graph.html` in a browser to view the dependency graph. Supporting assets are in `static/`.
